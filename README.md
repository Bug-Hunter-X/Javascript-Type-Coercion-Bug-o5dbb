This repository contains a simple example of a common Javascript bug caused by type coercion. The bug is demonstrated in the file `bug.js` and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  Type coercion in Javascript can be a source of unexpected behavior, particularly for developers coming from strongly-typed languages. The solution focuses on using explicit type checking or conversion to ensure the expected behavior.
